.TH SURF 1 "20 August 98"
.SH NAME
surf \- visualization of algebraic curves and surfaces
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsurf\fP [filename] [-toolkitoption ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsurf\fP provides a GUI for rendering algebraic curves and surfaces
interactively. The only input needed is the equation of an
algebraic curve/surface in everyday mathematical notation. The
output is either a (series of) color image(s) in the formats
XWD, SUN or FLI (via fbm2fli), or a black
and white image in either postscript, TIFF, XBM  or TeX pk format.
\fBsurf\fP also provides a C-style command language which helps
working out more complicated equations. The resolution of
an image is only bounded by the available memory. Since the
image is stored as an array of floats and because some
image processing algorithms need a copy of the image, you need
at least width*height*12 bytes of virtual memory. \fBsurf\fP can
handle curves/surfaces up to degree 30. The main features include
\fBalgebraic curves\fP, \fBalgebraic surfaces\fP, \fBhyper plane sections\fP, \fBlines
on surfaces\fP, \fBmultiple curves/surfaces\fP,
\fBadaptive anti aliasing\fP and \fBdithering\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBsurf\fP accepts  all of the standard X Toolkit command line
options (see \fBX\fP(1)).

.SH BUGS
The GUI is not fool proof. Beware pressing any button except
the stop button when calculating an image.
Usually images of curves/surfaces
are not correct if equations are not reduced.
