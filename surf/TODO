Here are some minor problems I can think of:

* handling of pow/sunpow:
  Somehow I believe, that this is really broken. At least it hasn't been
  tested for a while. Are there any implementations of pow with pow(0,0)!=1 ?
  Maybe we should exit from the configure script if we see that pow(0,0)!=1.

* set_size:
  Check that the set_size command isn't really needed any more.

* OctNode::TestBit:
  What does it do and is it correct in what it does ???
  I don't believe so.

* Matrix::threadedDeterminant
  Make the threaded version work.

* libtiff/libjpeg/zlib
  Disable tiff/jpeg support if one of the above isn't there instead of
  forcing the user to install 'em.
