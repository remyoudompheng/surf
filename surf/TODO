Here are some minor problems I can think of:

* Do we really have to specify those constants for resolution? Why
  not just set resolution to the desired DPI value!?

* OctNode::TestBit:
  What does it do and is it correct in what it does ???
  I don't believe so.

* Matrix::threadedDeterminant
  Make the threaded version work.
