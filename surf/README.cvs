If you read this file, you probably have obtained surf from its cvs
repository. To compile the source try the following:

./autogen.sh      This will create and run the configure script. You
                  need autoconf, automake, gtk, gmp and lot's of other
                  stuff.
make              This will build the surf executable. If the first
                  step succeeds, you'll have a very good chance to 
                  get a working executable.
./surf
