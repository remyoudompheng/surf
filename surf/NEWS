Version 1.1.0 - ??? 2001

There were some huge changes from version 1.0.x to 1.1.0. You may want
to look over them if you are familiar with older surf versions.


Separation of Kernel and GUI
============================

The biggest change: From now on, the binary "surf" is just a kernel
which reads script files and executes them. The whole GUI work is now
done by "gtksurf", the separated new GTK+/Glade based graphical frontend
to surf.


Triangulation Support
=====================

It is highly recommended that you install GTS---the GNU Triangulated
Surface library---before compiling surf, since then the surf kernel will
have some nifty new features allowing you to produce triangulated data
of algebraic surfaces. Images produced with this data (for example by
Geomview, an excellent 3D image viewer) aren't as nice as the rendered
images by surf but you can realize stuff like interactive real-time
animations. gtksurf uses this feature in its Naviagation window, where
you can rotate/translate/scale surfaces interactively.

GTS is available from   http://gts.sourceforge.net

The new commands introduced for these triangulation features are
"triangulate_surface" and "save_three_d_image". You may want to read the
corresponding sections in the manual, too.


New file formats
================

Depending on the libraries and header files you have installed on your
system (they're all optional!), surf will have compiled-in support for
the following new file formats:

- 8bit PNG (libpng and png.h needed)

- 24bit true color TIFF images (libtiff and tiffio.h needed)

- If you have GTS and thus access to the triangulation mentioned above,
  you may save the 3D data as .srf files (the native GTS file format)
  or OOGL/OFF files (the Geomview file format).

- If you have (additionally to GTS) X, OpenGL & GLU and OpenInventor
  libraries and header files on your system, you can save 3D files as
  Inventor (.iv) files.

Note: Support for the XWD format has been removed since that would have
required some (otherwise unnecessary) X dependancies.


Changes Concerning the Requirements
===================================

As a pure kernel, surf doesn't need any GTK+ or X libraries any more.
(On the other hand gtksurf does need them of course..)

It is highly recommended---but not mandatory---to have GTS, the GNU
Triangulated Surfaces library, because you won't be able to use any of
the triangulation features mentioned above. Note: GTS needs GLIB.

surf doesn't use threads any more, so the pthreads dependancy has
vanished.
