This file describes what's new in version 1.0.x of surf. It is meant
as a companion to the documentation found in docs. The documentation
describes version 0.91 and has yet to be updated to match version
1.0.x (writing documentation is one of the worst things I can think
of, but I'll hope that I find the time and enough beer to do it.).
The examples/new directory contains scripts showing the new features.


Version 1.0.0
=============

* autoconf/automake build system. See INSTALLATION.

* Uses the GTK toolkit instead of the outdated XView.

* New supported image formats: 
  color pictures      : ppm jpeg  
  black&white pictures: pbm pgm

* Support for bm2font picture format removed. TeX has no problems
  using postscript. Anyone out there with bm2font installed ???

* Support for drawing intersections of surfaces added. See the
  examples/new directory for some examples.

* Script mode added. Surf can now be started without a GUI (--no-gui
  command line option)

* lot's of other changes, I can't remember.
