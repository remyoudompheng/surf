What is gtksurf?
-----------------

gtksurf is GTK+-based graphical frontend to surf, the visualization tool
for real algebraic geometry. While surf is (meanwhile) a purely script-
driven kernel, gtksurf provides a nifty user interface to control most
features of the surf kernel.

Documentation can be found in the docs/ directory. If gtksurf is
installed correctly, a Texinfo-Manual will be available by typing
"info gtksurf" in a shell.

Visit surf's homepage for more information:

Requirements
------------

These are real requirements:

- (Kinda) ISO C++ compiler. This implies a working standard library with
  STL, too. g++ from the GCC 2.95 suite should suffice nevertheless.

- A make tool, preferably GNU make.

- GTK+ 1.2.0 or better.

- libglade (not to be confused with Glade). This is a library which
  allows applications to read in XML-files (*created* with Glade)
  containing a desription of their GUI and build up that GUI
  dynamically at run-time.

- OpenGL & GLU (or Mesa or some other OpenGL or OpenGL-like
  implementation).

- The GtkGLArea widget (which is in the libgtkgl library).


And these "requirements" are actually optional:

- If STLport includes and/or library are found at configure-time,
  they're used. This may be useful for people who don't have a
  sufficiently standard-conformable C++ compiler.

- An available gdk-pixbuf library will be used automatically.
  It's really recommended to have this library (and header files)
  installed, because the display of large images can become
  significantly faster.

- If you want to have "long versions" of the command line options,
  you'll need GNU's getopt_long() function. The configure script
  checks for libgnugetopt.



Basic Installation:
-------------------

If you installed all of the required stuff mentioned above, compilation
and installation below /usr/local/ should work "as usual":

    ./configure
    make
    (become root)
    make install

Type "./configure --help" to get a list of customization options.
More detailed (but generic) help can be found in the INSTALL file.
