REQUIREMENTS
============
- gcc 2.95 or up (any ISO C++ compiler should work...)
- GTK+ version 1.2.0 or later (only required if you want to compile surf with GUI support) 
- POSIX threads (If you have Linux make sure you use glibc2) 
- GNU MP (gmp) version 2 or later 
- GNU flex 2.5 or later

QUICK INSTALL
=============
Unpack the sources, cd to the surf-1.1.0 directory and type
  ./configure && make && make install

This should work in most cases and will install surf under the
/usr/local/ directory hierarchy.

ADVANCED INSTALL
================
The configure script can be given a number of options. Type
  ./configure --help
for a complete list. The important one are:

* --prefix=/path/for/installation     installation directory 
                                      (default:/usr/local)
* --disable-gui                       disable the gui
                                      (default is to build surf with gui)

Another way to control the behaviour of the configure script, is to
set some of the following environment variables before running configure:

 CC       : C compiler to use
 CXX      : C++ compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocessor (-I/another/include/path) 
 LDFLAGS  : Flags for the linker (-L/another/place/to/look/for/libs)


For example on FreeBSD 4.0 we use the following command to compile
surf (using a Bourne shell):
  export GTK_CONFIG="/usr/local/bin/gtk12-config"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" 
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/" 
  ./configure && make
